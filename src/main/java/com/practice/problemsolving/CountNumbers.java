* Given 2 integers (num1, num2), write a function that returns the count of numbers between the num1..num2 that are divisible by num1.
* E.g.: count(3, 15) returns 5 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15).
* Note : You need to consider Inclusive range & num1, num2 >= 0.
* INPUTS:  Two numbers num1, num2.
* OUTPUT: Return the count of numbers between the num1..num2 that are divisible by num1.
